Note:
*Implement accurate dialogue and scenes

Things to complete(in order):
1. Add internal dialogue in the black page.
2. Improve dialogue transition.
3. Implement thought UIs with options for dimming the background or not likely a bool.
4. Move through rooms by tapping 'Z'
5. Fix the GameScene.
6. Make text have animations, like shaking, bolding, or Itialacs. While allowing the screen to shake if needed.
7. Research GKStateMachine.
8. Make mapscene body for Cecilia, and any other added character: Sketch(Canva) -> ControlNet(ArtificalStudio.AI) -> Game.
9. Use enums or Central GameState store, or State-Driven UI, for different flashbacks, and scenes.
10. Add object interactions(with internal dialogue), and story progression. Including hiding places, being able to pickup items, new dialogues, different events in the story that activate flashbacks, updating the TODO list.
11. Add ways to choose dialogue, and add story pathways.
12. Implement dialogue for specific player actions, like walking into someone, or staring too long.
13. Add SFX sounds, for gameplay.
14. Add a 'save' file system, with story progress implemented within.
15. Tapm 'x' to open a UI page with inventory(as a list same size page), Audio(to interact with volume, SFX), Save, and Title. Then have to tap X again to exit.
16. Dark/Light changes.
17. Improve graphics, likely with a package.
18. Add apple game aspects, such as leaderboard, achivements, and perhaps...co-play mode? (GKGameCenterViewController).
19. Add time-based hints(if the player takes too long).
20. Make replays different for achievments.
21. Allow for saving progress...somehow. Maybe, GKLocalPlayer.
22. Add StoreKit, for in game payment options...such as donations, dialogue options, a way to pay to get achievments, or auction them to other players(with a % going to me).
23. Add an endscene credits list(Code - Me, Writing - Me, ect), that's very, very slow.
